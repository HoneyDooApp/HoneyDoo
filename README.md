# HoneyDoo: The family to-do list.

At HoneyDoo, we care about getting things done. You should too, especially getting household chores done.  HoneyDoo has created an awesome way to help assign chores around the house and allow families to get on with getting things done. We do this by automating the assignment and tracking of chores in our HoneyDoo List that can easily be shared with household members.   

It’s simple, decide who is the manager of members (MOM) in your household and the MOM will set up the family in our multi-tenant database. Your data is secure and no other households will have access to your household chore data, unless the MOM grants them secure access through our chore portal.
